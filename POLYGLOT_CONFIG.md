### Configure number of devices

For each device, increase count to match number of physical devices you have. If you don't have any devices of that type, leave it as *0*.

Click "Save Changes". Then restart the server or run *Re-Discover* command in AVRemote controller.

### Configure individual devices

Once the number of devices is configured, set individual devices parameters. Usually only *host name* is needed. *description* is optional but will help in ISY Admin Console.
